# PowerOverFiberControlModule
Code for my low-power PoF sensor project

The project consists of a Control Module and a Sensor Module being connected by a single strand of optical fiber transferring both data and power between the 2 modules. The prototype that was developped was part of my master thesis and served as proof of concept.
The Control Module is operated by a microcontroller reading the data coming back from the sensor and presenting said incoming data on a screen.
